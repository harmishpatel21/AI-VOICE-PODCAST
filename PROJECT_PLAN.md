Project: Voices of Wit - AI Podcast with Samay Raina & Prakhar ke Pravachan

Goal:
Create a fictional podcast episode featuring Samay Raina and Prakhar ke Pravachan discussing comedy. Use scraped transcripts to learn their styles, generate a realistic conversation using an LLM, and synthesize their voices into a complete podcast audio file.

Phase 1: Data Collection

Identify YouTube channels and podcast sources for Samay Raina and Prakhar ke Pravachan.

Extract transcripts:

If auto-generated captions are available, use youtube-transcript-api.

If not available, download audio using yt-dlp and use AWS Transcribe to generate transcripts.

Tools:

youtube-transcript-api

yt-dlp

AWS Transcribe (60 minutes/month free on AWS free tier)

Phase 2: Style Modeling and LLM Conversation

Analyze transcripts to understand each speakerâ€™s style:

Vocabulary

Sentence structure

Humor pattern

Tone

Generate fictional podcast script using LLM (GPT-4 or AWS Bedrock).
Prompt example:
"Imagine a podcast conversation on the topic of comedy between Samay Raina and Prakhar ke Pravachan. Samay uses observational, quirky, and witty humor. Prakhar responds with deep, philosophical takes that turn funny. Make it a 5-minute chat."

Save the result to generated_script.txt.

Phase 3: Voice Cloning

Choose a tool:

ElevenLabs (free tier available)

Bark (open-source)

Coqui.ai (open-source)

Amazon Polly (TTS only; cloning may not be free)

Convert each line from the script to audio using the selected voice tool.

Save each clip as a separate .wav or .mp3 file in an audio_segments folder.

Phase 4: Podcast Audio Assembly

Use Python and pydub to stitch all audio files together in order with pauses between dialogues.

Optionally, add background music or ambience using ffmpeg and layering.

Final output: final_podcast.mp3
